# ðŸŒŸ Ojaswithaâ€™s Python Journey

> *"Every AI Engineer starts with 'Hello, world' â€” this is mine."*

Welcome to my personal coding journey â€” from knowing nothing about Python to becoming a full-fledged **AI/ML Engineer** by the end of 2025.  
This space is my digital notebook, version-controlled journal, and proof that growth is always a choice.

## ðŸ§  Why this repo exists

I created this repository to:

- Track my daily practice and progress in Python & AI
- Celebrate small wins and commit them publicly
- Build a solid foundation toward my dream role
- Look back and say: *"This is where it all began."*
